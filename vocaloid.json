He had a sub-name called DEKOUS*UK when cooperating with kous and sasakure.UK in ef's album (恋色クローバーピース). Lately, DECO*27 has been collaborating with kous on a fair number of original songs. While kous provides the arranges, DECO*27 is responsible for the music and lyrics. DECO*27 is also known to frequently collaborate with sasakure.UK. He picked 'DECO' (lit. 'forehead') because he has a large one and the numbers '2' and '7,' because they are his favorite numbers. A glance at his keyboard inspired the asterisk. The numbers '27' are read 'nii-na,' as per the Japanese pronunciation.[1] DECO*27 had been stretching his limits outside of VOCALOID. He composed and arranged a song called 'FEVER' for the Hello! Project group Buono!, which was the first track in their mini-album SHERBET. He also composes songs for various animes and video games.",
